# Malicious-Actors-influence-Computer-Network-Traffic-with-Complex-Network-Analysis


The research paper titled "Discovering the Extent to which Malicious Actors influence Computer Network Traffic with Complex Network Analysis" by a team from the University of Central Florida. The study focuses on using Complex Network Analysis (CNA) tools to visualize and analyze computer network traffic, particularly for detecting malicious activities.

Key aspects of the paper include:

1. Utilization of Python and CNA tools to convert network traffic captures into graphs for visualization and analysis.

2. Use of the IoT-23 dataset, which contains labeled malicious traffic from simulated IoT device scenarios.

3. Exploration of graph networks as a powerful tool in cybersecurity for modeling and analyzing intricate relationships in cyber threats.

4. Discussion of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and its role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about potential or actual cyber threats.

5. Methodology involving data extraction from network captures, graph creation using tools like NetworkX and PyVis, and advanced visualization using Gephi.

6. Analysis of both benign and malicious network traffic, with visual representations showing differences in network structures and communication patterns.

7. Findings that reveal important network metrics, such as diameter, average path length, modularity, and number of communities within the analyzed networks.

8. Identification of key nodes that serve as potential routers or hubs, which could be high-value targets for malware.

The paper demonstrates how CNA can provide valuable insights into network behavior, potentially enabling better detection and mitigation of cyber threats. It also highlights the challenges in visualizing large-scale network data and the importance of using appropriate tools for analysis[1].
